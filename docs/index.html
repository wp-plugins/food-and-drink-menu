	<h1>Guide to the Food and Drink Menu plugin for WordPress</h1>
	<p>This guide will help you install and configure the plugin for your site.</p>
	<p>Further support for this plugin can be found at <a href="http://themeofthecrop.com/?utm_source=Plugin&utm_medium=Plugin%20Help%20Documentation&utm_campaign=Food%20and%20Drink%20Menu">themeofthecrop.com</a>.</p>

	<a name="install"></a>
	<h2>Installation</h2>
	<p>The following steps describe how to upload the Food and Drink Menu plugin to an
		existing WordPress installation. If you have not yet installed WordPress, consult the
		<a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress">WordPress
		documentation</a> for more information.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Unpack the food-and-drink-menu.zip file. It should create a folder
			named <code>/food-and-drink-menu/</code>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Upload the <code>/food-and-drink-menu/</code> folder to your
			WordPress plugin directory at <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Go to your WordPress admin dashboard at yoursite.com/wp-admin and
			click the <strong>Plugins</strong> item in the menu on the left.
		</li>
		<li>
			Find <strong>Food and Drink Menu</strong> in the list of Plugins
			and click the <strong>Activate</strong> link below the plugin name.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>The plugin is now active. Next you'll need to create your first menu.</p>

	<a name="create"></a>
	<h2>Create a menu</h2>
	<p>To generate your menu, you'll create Menu Items and then add them to a Menu.
		Menu Items work just like posts. Go to the <strong>Menu Items > Add Menu
		Item</strong> page in the admin dashboard. <em>Note: The Menu Items page
		will appear in the left menu, just like Posts, Pages and Comments, in your
		WordPress admin dashboard.</em></p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Fill out the details for a Menu Item just like you would for a Page or Post.
			A Menu Item is one item from your menu, like a Butternut Squash Soup or Gourmet Burger.
		</li>
		<li>
			Look on the right, under the panel where you would find the Publish button, and
			find the Menu Sections area.
		</li>
		<li>
			You probably don't have any menu sections set up yet, so click the link to
			<strong>Add New Menu Section</strong>. Add the appropriate section for this item --
			something like Starters, Desserts or Entrees.
		</li>
		<li>
			Go ahead and have a look around and you'll find other sections, including one where
			you can set a price. Once you're done, click the <strong>Publish</strong> button to
			publish this item.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Go ahead and create a couple more Menu Items. We'll want at least two Menu Sections before
		we create the menu, so make sure you've added a couple items to different sections.</p>
	<p>When you're ready, go to the <strong>Menus > Add New Menu</strong> page in the admin
		dashboard and follow these steps to create your menu.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Find the <strong>Menu Layout</strong> section. It should display the Menu Sections you
			set up earlier alongside two columns.
		</li>
		<li>
			Add a section to one of the columns by clicking on the section next to that column.
			Repeat the process until you've assigned all the sections to one or both of the columns.
		</li>
		<li>
			If you want to change the order of the sections or just remove one, click on it where it
			appears in the column. <em>It will appear green where it has been "added" to the menu
			and grey when it is "waiting" to be added.</em>
		</li>
		<li>
			Once you're happy with your menu, click on the Publish button. You'll then be able to view
			it by clicking the Preview Changes button, which appears above the Publish button.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>You've got your menu set up now. But you probably want to link to it in your site menu or add
		it to an existing sidebar, page or post. don't leave this page just yet. Read the next section to 
		find out how you can add the menu to any page, post or sidebar.</p>

	<a name="add_menu"></a>
	<h2>Link to the food and drink menu from your navigation menu</h2>
	<p>Your menus and menu items are now post types within WordPress, just like pages and posts. That
		means you can easily add them to any navigation menus you have set up on your site.</p>
	<p>To do this, go to the <strong>Appearance > Menus</strong> page in the admin dashboard. If you're
		not sure how to use these menus, read the 
		<a href="http://easywpguide.com/wordpress-manual/appearance/updating-the-menu/">Easy WP Guide</a>,
		which tells you all about how to use them.</p>
	<p>You'll find all of your menus and menu items under the sections on the left, where you see sections
		like Pages, Links and Categories. If you don't see them there, look at the top right of your
		admin dashboard for the <strong>Screen Options</strong> tab. Click that to open the options
		and then make sure that Menus and Menu Items are checked.</p>

	<a name="add_shortcode"></a>
	<h2>Add the menu to a page, post or sidebar</h2>
	<p>You may want to add your menu or menu item directly to a page, post or sidebar. To do this,
		navigate to the menu or menu item in your admin dashboard and click the <strong>Edit</strong>
		button. This will open the page where you can edit your menu or menu item.</p>
	<p>Look under the <strong>Publish</strong> panel on the right to find
		the <strong>Menu Shortcode</strong> panel (it will be in the column, but it might be below other
		panels as well). Here you'll find the shortcode you'll want to copy.
		It will look like: <code>[fdm-menu id=1234]</code></p>
	<p>You can paste this shortcode into the body of any page or post content and it will display
		your menu. You can find a shortcode for each Menu Item as well by looking at the same place
		on the editing page for those items. <a href="#shortcode">Learn more about you can customize 
		the shortcode display.</a></p>
	<p>The other way to display your menu is with a widget. Go to the <strong>Appearance > Widgets</strong>
		section in the admin dashboard. Find the <strong>Food and Drink Menu</strong> widget and the
		<strong>Food and Drink Menu Item</strong> widget and add either of them to
		any sidebar.</p>

	<a name="adv"></a>
	<h3>Advanced options</h3>
	<p>You can customize a few of the settings for this plugin by going to the settings page at
		<strong>Settings > Food and Drink Menu</strong>. Here you can disable specific features
		for the menu, such as the pricing information. This can be useful if you want to clean up
		the add/edit page details for a client.</p>
	<p>You can also modify the thumbnail size that WordPress automatically generates for Menu 
		Items. This will not necessarily change the size of the image as it is displayed on your
		website. You may need to change your theme's CSS code to change that. This setting only
		changes the size of the underlying image file that is served. You should only change
		these settings if you know what you're doing. <em>Note: this does not work retroactively.
		Any photos already uploaded will not have the new sizes until you upload them again.</em></p>

	<a name="shortcode"></a>
	<h3>Shortcode parameters</h3>
	<p>This section is for advanced users who wish to use optional parameters with the shortcode.</p>
	<p><em>At the moment, there are no custom options available for the menu shortcode. More will
		be added in the future.</em></p>
